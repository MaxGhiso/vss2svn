<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>The Vss2Svn project contains several components:</p>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vss2Svn</span>
is a Windows GUI application that exports all or
parts of an existing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms950420.aspx">Visual
SourceSafe 6.0</a> (VSS) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_SourceSafe">Wikipedia</a>]
repository to a new <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a>
repository. It attempts to construct
meaningful changesets (i.e. <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn-book.html#svn.branchmerge.changesets">SVN
commits</a>) based on chronologically
grouping individual project/file revisions.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VssDump</span>
is a console-based diagnostic tool that prints a
plain-text dump of the contents of a&nbsp;VSS repository.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VssLogicalLib</span>
provides a .NET API for reading the contents
and history of a&nbsp;VSS repository.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VssPhysicalLib</span>
is a set of low-level classes for reading
the various data files that make up a&nbsp;VSS database.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">HashLib</span>
is a generic stateless hashing API that currently
provides 16- and 32-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
generation.</li>

</ul>

<p>All components are written in C# using the Microsoft <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx">.NET
Framework 3.5</a>.</p>

<h2>How is it licensed?</h2>

<p>Vss2Svn is open-source software, licensed under the <a href="LICENSE.html">Apache License, Version 2.0</a> (<a href="LICENSE.txt">plain text</a>).
Accordingly,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">any
use of the
software is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at
your own risk</span></span>. Always back up your VSS
database
regularly, and especially before attempting to use this software with
it.</p>

<h2>What are its goals?</h2>

<p>Several key features not found in other VSS migration tools
inspired this project:</p>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preserving as
much history as possible from the VSS database</span>, including
deleted and renamed files. Vss2Svn replays the history of the VSS
database from the very beginning, so it is possible to reconstruct any
prior version of the tree. Only explicitly destroyed or externally
archived (but not restored) history should be lost. Ideally, a migrated
VSS database should never need to be consulted again.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making
historical changes easily comprehensible</span>. Migration tools
that simply do a one-pass traversal of the files currently in the
repository, replaying all the revisions of each file as it is
encountered, generate version history that is difficult to correlate
among multiple files. Vss2Svn scans the entire repository for
revisions, sorts them chronologically, and groups them into
conceptually changesets, which are then committed in chronological
order. The resulting repository should appear as if it
were&nbsp;maintained in SVN right from the beginning.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Robustness,
recoverability, and minimal user intervention</span>.
Vss2Svn aims to be robust against common VSS database inconsistencies,
such as missing data files, so that migration can proceed unattended.
However, serious errors, such as SVN reporting an error during commit,
necessarily suspend migration. In such cases, the user is presented
with an
Abort/Retry/Ignore dialog, so that manual intervention is an option.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed</span>.
Vss2Svn takes negligible CPU time. It can scan and build changesets for
a 300MB+ VSS database with 6000+ files and 13000+ revisions in about 30
seconds (or under 2 seconds if the files are cached) on a modern
desktop machine. Total migration
time is about an hour, with 98% of the time spent in SVN.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>

</ul>

<p>Admittedly, some potentially interesting features are
currently outside the scope of the project, such as:</p>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Incremental
migration</span>. Vss2Svn currently always exports the entire
history of the selected files, and it does not attempt to handle
conflicts with files already in the SVN repository prior to migration.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Handling of
corrupt databases</span>. Vss2Svn will fail to process VSS data
files with CRC errors. If you encounter such errors, run the VSS
Analyze.exe tool with the "-f" option. Make sure to back up your
database first. </li>

</ul>

<h2>How well tested is it?</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This
code has not been extensively tested.</span>&nbsp;Vss2Svn
was developed in about 2 weeks with the primary
purpose of migrating HPDI's VSS database to SVN. With more than 300MB
of data and 13000 revisions committed over 7 years, that should be
reasonably representative of a large repository, but it is only one
dataset. If you decide to use Vss2Svn, please let me know how it works
for you, and if you'd like me to add stats for your database here.</p>

<h2>Usage tips</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Run Vss2Svn on a local <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">backup
copy</span> of your repository. Not only will this avoid
jeopardizing your production repository, the migration will run much
faster accessing a local copy than one on a network share.</li>

  <li>Real-time virus/malware scanners, including Windows
Defender, can
interfere with SVN updating its index file, causing it to fail with
errors like "fatal: Unable to write new index file". You may need to
configure these tools to exclude scanning the output SVN repository
path if possible, or temporarily disable them if not.</li>

  <li>Generally, the SVN output directory should be empty or
non-existent. When re-running the migration, you should delete
everything in the directory,&nbsp;including the .git subdirectory.
(Vss2Svn doesn't do this for you for two reasons: 1) to avoid
accidental data loss, and 2) to allow merging of repositories.)
Vss2Svn currently uses "git add -A" when committing changes, so any
untracked files that happen to be present will be included in the first
commit.</li>

  <li>Migration can start at any&nbsp;project in the VSS
database and includes all subprojects. VSS paths start with "$" as the
root project, with subproject names separated by forward slashes (e.g.
"$/ProjectA/Subproject1").</li>

  <li>You can exclude files by name from the migration by listing
patterns in the dialog box. The patterns are separated by semicolons
and may include the following wildcards:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>"?" matches any single character except a slash or
backslash.</li>

    <li>"*" matches zero or more characters except&nbsp;slash
or backslash.</li>

    <li>"**" matches zero or more characters (including slash and
backslash).</li>

  </ul>

  <li>VSS has some features that have no&nbsp;analogous
feature in SVN. For instance:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Similarly, shared files are not directly supported.
Vss2Svn will write each revision of a shared file to each directory it
is shared in, but once migration is complete, future changes must be
kept in sync by the user. SVN technically supports using symlinks to
achieve a similar effect, but by default on Windows, they are checked
out as plain files containing a text link.</li>

    <li>Directories are tracked in SVN, as they
are in VSS. Consequently, actions on empty directories are 
preserved.</li>

    <li>VSS labels are applied to specific projects. Vss2Svn
translates these as special directories, which are global to the repository.</li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Currently, only one VSS project path is supported. To
include disjoint
subtrees of your database, you'll need to run Vss2Svn multiple times.
Unfortunately, this means that the commits won't be in chronological
order overall, and that commits containing files from separately
migrated projects will never be combined.</li>

  <li>Exported svn history does not conform to changeset merging 
rules due to destroyed items.</li>

  <li>An existing SVN working copy with initial structure is required.
The program does not check for required structure. Required directories
are /trunk, /tags, /vsslabels. These cannot be changed at the moment.</li>

  <li>No option to disable migration of VSS labels.</li>

  <li>No option to toggle output of VSS labels migration 
i.e special directories or SVN tag.</li>

  <li>SVN errors are not trapped by the Abort/Retry/Ignore dialog</li>

</ul>
